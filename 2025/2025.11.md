   Except the common knowledge to save Python sequential container memory usage, like `array`, `numpy`, `__slot__`, it also introduces some Python data structure modules and libraries, such as `memory_profiler`, `pympler`, `mmap`, `numpy.memmap`, https://github.com/pytries.

- Read [How to write better scientific code in Python?](https://zerowithdot.com/improve-data-science-code/)
  This is a fantastic article, it demonstrates Python coding best practice in 2 examples:
  1. Compute statistics mean of samplings.
    Compare to naïve hard coded logic, he breaks down each part to separate functions. Each of them can be customized, type hinted, for the sampling function that doesn't return `int` or `float`, such as throwing coin that return head tail character, he uses adapter lambda to convert to numeric value. He also uses `abc` module to make base class well defined abstract method. He also shows how to use `dataclass` and its `frozen` flag to create immutable class. Using `numpy` function to compute the sampling can make it run faster.
  2. The second example is computing `e` with given iteration and tolerance.
    It demonstrates the usage of Python `functools` standard library functions to break down operations and organize in good software engineering thinking. These functions concatenates operations that return generator. This is a good example of functional programming!
	The breaking down data processing pipeline to separate generators is a good example to learn. The `itertools.pariwise()` is first time to know how it actually can be used.
