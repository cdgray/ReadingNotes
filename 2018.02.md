Watch **Two minites paper**
- None of These Faces Are Real
- AI Learns Real-Time Defocus Effects in VR

	The paper "DeepFocus: Learned Image Synthesis for Computational Displays" and its source code is available here:

	https://research.fb.com/publications/deepfocus-siggraph-asia-2018/

	https://www.oculus.com/blog/introducing-deepfocus-the-ai-rendering-system-powering-half-dome/

	https://github.com/facebookresearch/DeepFocus

	The defocus effects looks like dpeth field, it could applies to game/vfx. Need further reading.
- Learning Dexterous In-Hand Manipulation
- Extracting Rotations The Right Way

	http://matthias-mueller-fischer.ch/publications/stablePolarDecomp.pdf

	The simulation video looks awesome! Worth reading the paper.
	
Watch **CppCon**
- CppCon 2014: Lightning Talks - Marc Eaddy "Pimp my Log()"

	The expression template technique is cool to pack arguements together.
	
	Worth a try.

*201715 - Robust Hex-Dominant Mesh Generation using Field-Guided Polyhedral Agglomeration* by Xifeng Gao

	It's a algorithm to convert tri/quad mesh to Hex-Dominant mesh, compare to tetrahedra mesh.	
	Maybe it could be applied to FEM mesh generation.	
	https://github.com/gaoxifeng/robust_hex_dominant_meshing
	
	The paper refer to other 2 tetrahedra mesh libraries,

tyflow, a 3ds Max fx plugin. It's a rewrite of Particle Flow.

What's more, it's created by an animator!

- This AI Learned Image Decolorization..and More
	The paper "Deep Feature Consistent Deep Image Transformations: Downscaling, Decolorization and HDR Tone Mapping" is available here:
	
	https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09482
	
	https://houxianxu.github.io/assets/project/dfc-dit
	
	*My thought:* The paper use machine learning to improve image quality with multiple ways. Worth reading it.
