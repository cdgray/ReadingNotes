- Read [The Law of Leaky Abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/)
  An article from Joel Spolsky, I like it because in today's AI technology, the black-box characteristic of AI make the leaky hard to understand and fix. I prefer a clear and well defined methodology, compare to a statistic-based opaque encapsulated training model.

  This is the outbound link from [[2024.11#^8a748a|The Law of Leaky Abstractions]]
  It's an old article that most of its links have become invalid. The main point is don't believe the fancy ideas, they can be not as good as they declared,
  - Search engine results
  - TrueType
  - Network resources act like local ones
  It still applies nowadays, like AI, ML technology.

  Another outbound link from [[2024.11#^8a748a|The Law of Leaky Abstractions]]
  It discussed about:
  1. how to implement **strcat** efficiently, instead of using naive _Shlemiel the painter’s algorithm_, we should create a **String Builder** class or equivalent mechanism for this task.
  2. Run **SELECT author FROM books** SQL query in a ralational database is fast as each row size is fixed, just need a pointer offset. But for an XML doc database, the length of each row is indefinite so it takes longer time to do the query. This article is written on year 2001, the author can't know we have NoSQL for XML or any other doc now.
  The main idea of this article is don't ignore the CS first year courses, these basic knowledge still valuable to understand high level technology.

  As the title explains everything, after knowing this book uses Java as example, my interest is halved; then read the rest of the content of this article, I agree with author that this book is obsolete, or it should never be recommended.
  At the end, the author recommends another book, _A Philosophy of Software Design_ (2018) by John Ousterhout, the creator of Tcl language. It has 2nd edition now. I should read it.

- Re-read [The counter-intuitive rise of Python in scientific computing](https://cerfacs.fr/coop/fortran-vs-python)
  I've read it in [[2024.02#^62fe7f|in Feb]].This article advocates Python is a more agile and efficient language than Fortran in HPC area. It contains some great links of Python libraries for HPC, PDE and free online books.
  But it gives a wrong example that an old Fortran program use brutal force to do a point cloud computation, while the scipy uses kdtree do the same work. The result is Python solution takes a few minutes while the Fortran one takes hours.
  The main problem of Fortran is lesser young people learn it, even it still evolves.
  The fact is old language dies due to the old generations fade out.
  This blog is hosted by a French HPC/CFD group, which is a good source to keep reading.

- Read [How To Understand Things](https://nabeelqu.co/understanding)
  This article attracts me because following views:
  1. Thinking hard takes effort, it requests honesty and integrity characteristic of a person. You can't cheat yourself if you don't want to understand a thing thoroughly. The Nobel Prize winner William Shockley was fond of talking about “the will to think”.
  2. It's important to establish a direct experience by yourself, the author uses Michael Faraday's example.
  3. Don't afraid to look stupid. Keep asking questions. The authors uses the Leibniz notation in calculus as example, $\tfrac{dy}{dx}$. Most people will take this as a division and it seems work in chain rule, but it actually is not.  
  4. He also introduced Eliezer Yudkowsky's book [Rationality - From AI to Zombies](https://www.readthesequences.com/)
  5. He mentions the book **Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance**, which I knew it but haven't read it.
  6. At the end, he mentions [Michael Nielsen](https://michaelnielsen.org/)'s article, [Using spaced repetition systems to see through a piece of mathematics](https://cognitivemedium.com/srs-mathematics), which introduced Andrey Kolmogorov's essay about "*that the invention of the equals sign helped make possible notions such as equations (and algebraic manipulations of equations)*". The essay lacks of reference, I only find people ask for it in the [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=18896106)
  To conclude, this blog declares some insightful view meet my views and provide more external links to read on. His blog and Michael Neilsen's blog and twitter worth following and keep reading.

  2. Easy to modify
   You can easily change a piece of code without impacting things that use it
  3. Easy to identify side effects
   You can easily tell whether a piece of code requires/modifies external state
  4. Easy to avoid side effects
   You can use part of your code and deliberately bypass any external impact
