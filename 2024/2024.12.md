- Read [Leaving Rust gamedev after 3 years](https://loglog.games/blog/leaving-rust-gamedev/)
  This long article takes me a few days to finish, everyday a little bit. I don't finish all of them, especially when he talks about the Rust language details.
  The author worked some game projects with Rust and finally abandon it. He listed a lot of reasonable and details content, which I agree and realize the limitation of Rust language.
  What I got from this article is Rust is overrated as a robust, fast, secure, that is going to supersede C++ as a new systematic language. It is safe and strict on ownership check through borrower checker. But it lacks the flexibility when the users don't care about such check. It adds extra burden in such cases, which is especially true for game developers. Maybe Rust is only good for those highly care about system robust and safety app and libraries.
  
  Here are the rephrased items:
  1. Rust requires, encourages users to write correct, performant code, stop at any time you try to violate these rules even just to temporarily for a quick test, prototype. The borrow checker is such mechanism. It maybe very useful for system programmer to guarantee them to write correct concurrency code logic, but this philosophy kills the game designers as they want to try different play mode and decide which way to go.
  2. To somewhat bypass the borrow checker, some Rust game engines use language features, such as *Event* to describe game feature and logics, such indirect way harm the development speed and increase the complexity. 
  3. Rust introduces ECS pattern to the game development, advocate it is the best way to describe and define the game system. Compare to Unity's ECS, and DOTS system, Rust game engines use *generational arenas* data structure to access the data, which is overkill and make it hard to use.
  4. The ECS is an example that some Rust game engines try to make a general system to suit all kinds of game genre, but actually the indie game developer needs a handy and enough to use system to tinker and test their game prototype quickly, not try to be a language lawyer to refactor and fix every language violations.
  5. The author share a video link, [This Problem Changes Your Perspective On Game Dev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o5K0uqhxgsE) , that a indie game maker describes the most important thing for game development, search for the idea, fail fast. Don't spend time on writing clean code, polish the game assets. This opinion is contradicted with Rust language philosophy.
  6. Rust's procedural macro is another thing hard to use and increase the compile time, thus slow down the trial-and-error cycle. *Compile time reflection* is cancelled recently, make it worse.
  7. Then the author talked about the hot reloading technique. He showed the [Tomorrow Corporation Tech Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72y2EC5fkcE) video, which is a good example of an highly customized and powerful game development toolset and framework. It can hot reloading game assets, change level script, inspect script value, forward/reverse step between callstacks, playback game archives and debug it. Such tool is very useful for a game developer and is the holy grail for them.
  8. The Rust community lacks of mature game libraries, it depends on hype for those crippled game crates, such as Rapier the physics engine, which can crash on simple test cases, the author has to write his own 2d physics engine after meeting and reporting such problems. There are not so many good games are developed with Rust, its game ecosystem is far from mature.

  这篇文章延续上篇的历史，继续深入介绍牛顿法，涉及3个特性：
  1. 函数 _f_ 的光滑性，也就是在解的附近二次连续可微。
  2. 解 x* 的正则性，也就是雅可比矩阵在 x* 点可逆。
  3. 初始近似的局部性，也就是 x0 距离 x* 不太远。
  
  - 并且继续介绍了高斯如何解决超定方程组，发明了用矩阵的左逆代替传统逆矩阵。
  - 值得一提的是，牛顿法的二阶收敛并不是最快的求根计算方法。比较著名的三阶收敛迭代法有哈雷（Halley）迭代和拉盖尔（Laguerre）迭代，也就是每步迭代获得的精确数位是前一步的三倍。然而从实际计算的角度来看，超过二阶收敛的迭代法仅仅在解决特定问题上可能有些价值。作为通用算法，简单得不能再简单的牛顿法已经二阶收敛，其实际效率在计算中很难被真正超越。在此也希望年轻学者不要在研究通用高阶收敛迭代法的问题上浪费时间。**除非找到特定应用，超过二阶的收敛速度一般没有实际意义。**
   这条对于我很有意义，避免浪费时间去寻找此类通用算法解决工作问题。
  - 光滑性，也就是函数或映射 f 连续二阶可微在绝大多数实际应用中不成问题。对于导数不存在、无法求导或者雅可比矩阵计算成本太高的特定方程，可以使用拟牛顿法和创新不动点迭代。这基本上超出了牛顿法的范畴，在此就不多谈了。无需微分的算法难以利用微积分的线性逼近，因此都未能达到二阶高速收敛而无法成为通用算法。
 - 局部性，也就是初始迭代点 x0 取在所求解的一个局部邻域则牛顿法必定收敛。这常常被人误以为是牛顿法的一个弊病。局部收敛的对立面是所谓全局收敛（global convergence），也就是从定义域内的任何初始点出发都保证迭代收敛到一个解。全局收敛算法只存在于求解特定问题的特定迭代。
 - 采用牛顿法绘制美丽的图片，也是一个有趣的应用
 - 最后作者详细介绍了正则性。用通俗语言说，一个问题是正则的最一般的定义是，这个问题的解的变化上界跟问题数据扰动大小成比例。用数学语言说的话就是，问题的解利普希茨（Lipschitz）连续依赖于数据。
   正则性是数学上的一个重要性质。在计算数学里更是重要到不可或缺的程度。可以说计算数学只能解决正则问题。非正则的问题又称为奇异（singular）问题。奇异问题跟数值计算水火不容。所以在计算数学教科书上基本上找不到任何奇异问题的数值解法。因为教科书上没说，一个秘密就有点鲜为人知：**奇异问题常常可以正则化**。至于怎么正则化，那就是施展聪明才智的时候了。寻找正则化方法，探索奇异问题的数值解是计算数学尚未充分开发而又前景广阔的处女地。
 - 最后作者还介绍了最前沿的进展
