  It introduced the Lagrangian mechanics, Euler-Lagrange equation, D'Alembert's principle，Hamilton's principle.
  It refreshes my understanding to classical Newtonian mechanics.
  The most important opinion is:
  - It reveals how constraint force act and compute, which I only know the name but don't know the details before.
  - It introduces the *Virtual Work* and links it with constraint force.
    This is not described clearly in Watkin97's SIGGRAPH course notes of physics simulation.
  - The introduction of the D'Alembert's principle helps me understand the force equation

    Ma + Dv + F_int + F_ext = 0;

    in the *integrator* report.
